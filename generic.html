								<h2>FDP</h2>
								<p>FDP client is based off of liquidbounce legacy which has been unsupported for years now. FDP updates a good little bit to solve that.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
								<p>Made by SkidderMC, FDP offers amazing bypasses for servers, especially concidering its free. They have been around for a good minute and are especialy loved on BlocksMC which has the fattest staff and most god awful anticheat combo (Updated NCP + Verus). They also provide bypasses for other anticheats such as any server with vulcan't, watchdog if you get a good config, and in some rare cases even intave and polar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>DoomsDay</h3>
								<p>Doomsday client is a ghost client designed for any version of minecraft from 1.8+ and constantly updates. It is unique in that instead of putting it in your mods folder you double left click it and it opens. It injects into almost any version of minecraft from forge, to fabric, and even third party launchers like badlion or lunar. It has the ability to make itself its own version in the minecraft launcher which if you do means nothing is in your mods folder and you could delete the jar as it runs stright from the launcher.&nbsp;</p>
